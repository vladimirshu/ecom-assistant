# AI-Powered E-Commerce Assistant

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an AI assistant that allows customers to search and explore a product catalog using natural language questions (e.g., “Show me a red waterproof jacket under €100”).
The assistant combines semantic search with AI-based interpretation, clarification (“Can you show me the same jacket but in blue?”), and explanations.
This way customers can find products faster and more intuitively.

## Scope

### In Scope
* Uploading product catalog (CSV format)
* Natural language query processing
* AI-generated explanations of search results.
* Clarification loop when queries are incomplete or ambiguous.
* Web API endpoints (no large customer-facing UI, small demo UI is enough).
* Logging and metrics collection for evaluation.
* Compliance with EU AI Act and GDPR.

### Out of Scope
* Customer authentication and user accounts.
* Payment, checkout, cart, or order management.
